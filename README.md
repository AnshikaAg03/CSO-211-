#### Enhanced AM-Softmax Loss Implementation for Improved Classification

Designed and implemented Enhanced AM-Softmax loss to improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability for tasks like face recognition.
Introduced an additive margin to amplify angular separation between classes and an exponential scaling factor to reduce loss, resulting in better feature robustness and higher classification accuracy.
